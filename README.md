# Traffic_Conjuction_System
CENG Digital Design Term Project

The design of 4 traffic lights 8 pedestrian lights and 1 emergency call in a traffic control system

Lights works sequentialy in D FlipFlops and emergency is combinational imported to sequential design

This code incluedes gate design using Logism which is a programme for electrical design and it incluedes verilog code of the given State machine based design.

For using logism design you need to download it after that it will basically opened in the programme which is .circ extended file

In verilog, The design is made in Design Suite ISE of Xilinx. It has example testbench included to design.
